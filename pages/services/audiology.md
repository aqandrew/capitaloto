      - name: How the ear works
        body:
          - text: 'The ear is divided into three parts: the outer, middle, and inner ear. Each part performs an important function in the hearing process.'
          - image: diagrams/04_Natural-Hearing-Illustration_steps.jpg
          - text: The outer ear consists of the pinna (the part you see on the outside) and the ear canal. The outer ear serves to collect sound and funnel it to the middle ear. The tympanic membrane (eardrum) divides the outer from the middle ear. When sounds reach the eardrum, it to vibrates.
          - text: The middle ear consists of an air-filled cavity containing the three middle ear bones, called ossicles. These three bones are the malleus, incus, and stapes. The ossicles are connected and move together in a lever action to amplify sounds. The vibration of the eardrum moves these bones, which are also connected to the inner ear by the stapes.
          - text: The inner ear contains two parts, the cochlea (hearing part) and the vestibular (balance) part. The cochlea is a fluid filled organ that contains tiny hair cells. When the stapes moves, it puts the fluid in the cochlea in motion. The motion of this fluid stimulates the cochlea's hair cells at particular points, which stimulates nerve endings and converts the signal into an electrical impulse. The nerves transmit these impulses to the brain via the acoustic nerve. The brain interprets these signals as sound.
          - text: The cochlea is considered a tonotopic organ; this means that it consists of pitch-specific regions. Depending on where within the cochlea the stimulation occurs, a person will perceive different sounds.'
      - name: What is hearing loss?
        body:

          - text: Hearing loss affects 28 million Americans of all ages. It is categorized by the degree of loss, which can be mild, moderate, moderate-severe, severe, or profound. These categories are typically used to describe the amount of hearing loss in each frequency (pitch) region.
          - text: The tones used for testing hearing vary in frequency (Hertz or Hz) and intensity (decibels or dB). The softest level or intensity of sound that you respond to at each frequency (pitch) is referred to as a threshold. Threshold results are plotted on a graph called an audiogram.
          - text: Hearing levels on the audiogram between -10dB and 25dB are considered to be within the range of normal hearing. Someone with thresholds within normal range should be able to hear all speech sounds and most environmental sounds without much difficulty, especially when it is quiet.
            list:
              - <strong>Mild</strong> hearing loss range is 26-40dB. With hearing at this level, a person will only hear some of the speech sounds when spoken at a normal conversational volume. Many of the speech sounds will be missed if whispered or if background noise is present.
              - <strong>Moderate</strong> hearing loss is within the range of 41-55dB. A hearing loss of this level will result in most speech sounds being missed when spoken at a normal conversational volume.
              - <strong>Moderate-severe</strong> hearing loss is from 56-70dB, and results in the inability to hear <strong>any</strong> speech sounds when spoken at a normal conversational level.  Many sounds will missed when shouted as well.
              - <strong>Severe</strong> hearing loss is from 71-90dB.  Persons with this degree of hearing loss will not hear any speech sounds, and few environmental sounds, without amplification.
              - <strong>Profound</strong> hearing loss range is 91dB or more. At this level, a person will not hear speech sounds and very little environmental sounds, even with traditional amplification.

      - name: Tinnitus
        body:
          - text: Tinnitus is the perception of sound by a person when no external sound source is present. It can be perceived/heard in one or both ears, or somewhere in the head (not localized to a specific ear). It is often described as a ringing or buzzing sound, but other descriptions include hissing, chirping, clicking, whistling, roaring, or crickets. It is estimated that 40-50 million Americans have some degree of tinnitus. Roughly 75% of those with tinnitus are not significantly bothered by it, while the other 25% are bothered enough to seek medical treatment.
          - text: While the causes of tinnitus are often unknown, it does tend to occur with hearing loss, and with damage to the inner ear that may not have yet manifested as hearing loss. It frequently can occur as a result of loud noise exposure, such as a gun blast or a loud concert. Many medications and medical conditions have a possible side effect of tinnitus that can be either temporary or permanent. Additionally, there are several medical conditions whose symptoms include tinnitus&em;that is, tinnitus may be an early sign of a problem. If you suffer from tinnitus, it is important that you discuss it with your medical professional to rule out any possible treatable sources.
          - text: While there is generally no <em>cure</em> for tinnitus, there are many treatments available. Please speak to your medical professional before trying any treatment. For more information on tinnitus, please visit the <a href="http://www.ata.org/">American Tinnitus Association</a>.
